# The HERA Librarian

This system keeps track of all of the primary data products stored at a given
site. There is a Flask-based server that keeps track of everything using a
database and presents a nice frontend, and Python client code that can make
various requests of one or more servers.

All of the server code is in a subdirectory called `librarian_server`. See [the
README there](librarian_server/README.md) for information on how to run a
server.

Besides the server, this repository provides a Python module, `hera_librarian`,
that lets you talk to one *or more* Librarians programmatically. Some
documentation is available [here](docs/Accessing.md). Install it with
```
pip install .
```
from the top level of the repository.
